# Astro 
#### Work in Progress :construction:
Astro is a high-level, high-performance statically-typed programming language that compiles to WebAssembly, with syntax similar to Python and technical-computing orientation similar to Julia.

Astro provides a sophisticated compiler with full type inference, compile-time garbage collection, and an extensive mathematical function library.

Astro's core foundation is built on a rich type system and multiple dispatch but it borrows a lot of useful concepts from other paradigms as well.

Astro has support for first-class functions, generics, object-oriented programming, data-race-free concurrency, unicode identifiers, and metaprogramming.

Current Version: 0.1.9
