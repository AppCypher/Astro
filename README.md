# Astro
Astro is a high-performance statically-typed programming language that compiles to WebAssembly, with syntax silimar to Python and numerical-computing orientation similar to Julia. 

Astro provides a sophisticated compiler with full type inference, compile-time garbage collection, and an extensive mathematical function library. 

It pushes multiple dispatch as its primary paradigm and borrows a lot from other paradigms aas well. 

Astro supports first-class types, functions and hygenic macros.
